# AI Learning Lab

A simple web application that teaches kids how to steer and converse with language models.
The project is structured with a Python backend and a lightweight frontend that includes voice features.

## Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configure API keys**

Preferred: use the inâ€‘app Settings panel (gear icon) to add API keys. Keys are stored in the local SQLite DB with reversible encryption and are not exposed to the browser.

Development option: you can still read from a local `.env` if you opt in. Set `ALLOW_ENV_SECRETS=1` and place your keys in `.env`.

```bash
export ALLOW_ENV_SECRETS=1
```

Example `.env` for development:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

3. **Run the web server**

```bash
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/` to access the frontend served by the backend. The page can call the API endpoints directly without any cross-origin configuration.

Notes
- Speech transcription is proxied through the backend at `/speech/transcribe`; configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` via the Settings UI (or `.env` only if `ALLOW_ENV_SECRETS=1`).

### Avatar Gallery

- Browse generated avatars: open `http://localhost:8000/avatar-gallery`.
- Download any image: use the Download button in the gallery (served with attachment headers).
- Images are stored under `frontend/assets/characters/<id>/avatar-*.png` when created by `/characters/{char_id}/avatar/generate`.

### Image Generate

- Try the dedicated image panel at `http://localhost:8000/image_generate`.
- Enter a prompt, pick a style/size, and each result appears as an item in a chat-like feed with a download button.
- Files are saved under `frontend/assets/generated/img-*.png`.

### Optional: HTTPS for Voice Streaming

Some browsers require HTTPS for microphone access. A local Certificate Authority is bundled in `certs/ca.cert.pem`.
Import this certificate into your system or browser trust store, then start the server with SSL:

```bash
python backend/run_ssl.py
```

This will serve the app at `https://localhost:8000` using the trusted certificate.

## Testing

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the full testing strategy and instructions on running checks.

## Documentation

- Architecture overview: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Development notes and roadmap: [DEV_NOTES.md](DEV_NOTES.md)

## Next steps

- Add support for more model providers using openrouter list-available-models method
- Improve the frontend with templates and more kid-friendly styling.
- Expand voice capabilities and persistence of conversations.
- TODO: Add a "Config" toggle in the top bar that collapses/expands the sidebar on mobile (and optionally desktop), with smooth transition and saved preference.
- Stretch Goal: Package as an Android app using a web wrapper (PWA + TWA or Capacitor), including icon/splash and basic offline support.
